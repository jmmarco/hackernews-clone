# Hacker News Clone
A clone of the popular [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org) that leverages the [Unofficial Hacker News API](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi) to get all the stories.

## Quickstart
- Download the project repository or clone it
- Open the containing project folder and run `npm install`
- Run the project locally by running `npm start`

### Styles
Layout was done using the CSS Flexbox module and styles were applied using Zeit's [styled jsx] which looks something like this:
```
<style jsx>{`
  form {
    margin-bottom: 1em;
    padding-left: 20px;
  }

`}
```
